    <h1>Create a Website using HTML (Basic)</h1>
   <p>There are basically two ways to make a web page.The first way is to create a page(s) ofline and then
    upload them to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) via FTP.The second way is to create your web 
    page(s) online using a Telnet program by accessing your UNIX acount,if you have one.</p>
   <p>If you are creating your web page(s) offline,do so in any text editing or word processing document.
    Make sure that when you save your document,you save it as a "text","plain text"or "text only"
    document.Otherwise it will not be read properly by a web browser.Once you have created your page(s),
    you will need to contact your ISP about how to go about uploading them to your server.</p>
    <p>If you have a UNIX account,you can create your web page(s) online.You first need to get a program
        that can access your UNIX account.I recommend Telnet for the Mac or Ewan for windows 95/98.</p>
        <p>Once you access your account,you need to make a new directory called"public_html".You can
           do this by typing:</p>
           <h2>mkdir public_html</h2>
           <p>After this,change your directory to this new directory called"public_html".</p>
           <h2>cd public_html</h2>
           <p>If you want to,you can make other directories,one for all the web pages that you make,
            and one for all of the graphics that you have.Follow the same steps as above to do this.
           </p>
           <p>Next,you need to think of a file name for your page(this is not a title,but what will
            be in the URL).A common file name for a common web page,is"index".Once you've decided on this,
            add".html"to the end of it.Then type(i.e)
           </p>
           <h2>pico index.html</h2>
           <p>Of course, use your page's fiilename,instead of this one.Next,you need to gain some
            knowledge of the many HTML commands.Lucky for ou,I've already gotten some of the basic
        commands for you.Follow the index below,to decide what to put on your web page,and how to do it.
    Once you've gotten started,exit your page.You can do this by pressing <b>control-x</b>.Then you need
to type:  </p>
<h2>chmod744 index.html</h2>
<p>Only do this with the filename of your page.You only need to tih for the very first time that you
   leave youe web page.This command will make sure that nobody else can delete your page.You will need to
   do this to any other pages that you make in the future.Then,look at your page on
